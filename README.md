# Eiwaji

eiwaji is a Japanese-to-English lexer and dictionary. It uses [mecab](http://taku910.github.io/mecab/) (with help from [ve](https://github.com/Kimtaro/ve)) to analyze Japanese sentences and allows for easy offline lookup of the parsed terms using [JMDict](http://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/j_jmdict.html).
